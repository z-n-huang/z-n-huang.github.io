NUS Psycholinguistics Lab
======
My colleague [Aine Ito](https://aineito.github.io
) and I co-manage the psycholinguistics lab. This is a sound-proofed lab located in the same building as our department (AS5, #02-04), well-equipped for in-person experiments and data analysis. Listed below are some of the resources that we have:

+ Equipment
  + SR EyeLink 1000 Plus eyetracker
  + A HP desktop computer
+ Software
  + Qualtrics
  + Ibex (created by Alex Drummond), locally installed on the lab computer
  + A standard suite of software: Praat, Python, R, Microsoft Office
+ Corpora 
  + ICE-SIN
  + ICE-GB
  + Corpus of Contemporary American English
  + Penn Treebank
  + English Web Treebank
  + Chinese Treebank 
  + National Corpus of Singapore English -- a treebank that Bao Zhiming and I have been developing. We are unable to make the raw files publicly available, but please reach out if you have any questions.
  + ... (NUS has a subscription to the Linguistic Data Consortium)


Language and Linguistics Cluster
======
The NUS [Language and Linguistics Cluster](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/language-and-linguistics-cluster/) organises talks and seminar around psycholinguistics, linguistic theory, and sociolinguistics. There are also reading groups on sociolinguistics and syntax-semantics (and some experimental linguistics)

Other resources
======
+ [Phrase Structure Tree Editor](https://z-n-huang.github.io/psedit/tree_editor2c.html). An online drag-and-drop syntax tree editor I created as part of a Singapore English corpus project.
