I am an assistant professor at the [Department of English, Linguistics and Theatre Studies](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/elts/) at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/).

What I do
======
I am a linguist interested in understanding the relation between linguistic experience, sentence processing, and grammars and what that relation might mean for our theories of language and the mind. More specifically, I'm interested in questions like:
1. How do children make use of what is spoken around them to figure out the rules of their native languages? 
1. How are adults apply these rules in production and comprehension?
1. And what even are these rules, anyway? And what are the facts like for production and comprehension, anyway?
 
On a day-to-day basis, I develop more precise descriptions of linguistic knowledge and behaviour (Question 3), often taking a cross-linguistic perspective and using formal experiments. Addressing Question 3 sets the stage for tackling Questions 1 and 2, which I  a combination of corpus analyses and computational models. 

Finally, as someone who grew up in a multilingual, code-switching environment, I am also interested in dialectal variation and language contact, such as Singapore English.

Some specific topics that I have worked on:
+ cross-linguistic differences in the syntax and meaning of attitude verbs, such as *think*, *want*, *know*, and how children might learn what the facts are for these verbs in their native languages
+ the syntax, pragmatics, and psycholinguistics of long distance dependencies (e.g. wh-questions)
+ Singapore English and how certain aspects of its grammar might be traced (or not!) to adstrate languages like English, Chinese, and Malay varieties.

Supervision
======
NUS is an exciting place for doing linguistics (see "Resources"). Please get in touch if you are interested!

Recent updates
======
+ I will be giving one of the plenary talks at the [7th Asian Junior Linguists Conference](https://sites.google.com/view/ajl7/home), to be held at the International Christian University, Tokyo, Japan. I will be presenting some of my work on attitude verbs.
+ [How subjects and possessors can obviate phasehood](https://doi.org/10.1162/ling_a_00414) is now published in the latest issue of *Linguistic Inquiry*. In this paper, I evaluate recent proposals about locality effects (specifically, phases), with a series of experiments. I discuss ways of deriving these effects from two independently-motivated proposals. I further show that a similar effect exists in the nominal domain, suggesting that clauses and nominals are structurally parallel in this respect.
