I am an assistant professor at the [Department of English, Linguistics and Theatre Studies](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/elts/) at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/).

What I do
======
I am a linguist interested in understanding the relation between linguistic experience, sentence processing, and grammars and what that relation might mean for our theories of language and the mind. More specifically, I'm interested in questions like:
1. How do children make use of what is spoken around them to figure out the rules of their native languages? 
1. How are adults apply these rules in production and comprehension?
1. But a more basic question: what are these rules? And what are the facts like for production and comprehension?
 
On a day-to-day basis, I develop more precise descriptions of linguistic knowledge and behaviour (Question 3), often taking a cross-linguistic perspective and using formal experiments. Addressing this question sets the stage for addressing Questions 1 and 2, which I tackle with a combination of corpus analyses, computational models, and experiments.

Finally, as someone who grew up in a multilingual environment in Singapore, I am also interested in dialectal variation and language contact, especially Singapore English.

Some specific topics that I have worked on:
+ cross-linguistic differences in the syntax and meaning of attitude verbs, such as "think", "want", "know", and how children might learn what the facts are for these verbs in their native languages.
+ the syntax, pragmatics, and psycholinguistics of long distance dependencies (e.g. wh-questions), which again involve attitude verbs.
+ cross-linguistic differences in whether ungrammatical sentences sound bad or surprisingly OK (i.e. "grammaticality illusions").
+ Singapore English and how certain aspects of its grammar might be traced (or not!) to adstrate languages like English, Chinese, and Malay varieties.

Collaboration and supervision
======
NUS is an exciting place for doing linguistics (especially languages of East and Southeast Asia), with [lab facilities, corpora](https://z-n-huang.github.io/nus-resources/), and a community of [like-minded faculty and students](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/elts/). Please get in touch if you are interested.

Recent updates
======
+ Co-presenting with my colleague [Zheng Shen](https://zheng-shen.github.io/) experimental research on cross-linguistic variation in wh-dependencies (viz. English and Mandarin) at several upcoming conferences: Conference on Human Sentence Processing, GLOW 46, the UPenn workshop on Locality in Theory, Processing, and Acquisition, the Workshop on Theoretical East Asian Linguistics 13. This project builds on work by Zheng on wh-extraction from DPs as well as my own work, published in *[How subjects and possessors can obviate phasehood](https://doi.org/10.1162/ling_a_00414)* (*LI*, 2022)
+ Co-presenting with [Colin Phillips](https://www.colinphillips.net/) [a poster](https://z-n-huang.github.io/files/HuangPhillips2023_HSP_illusions_Mar2023.pdf) on Mandarin centre-embedding illusions at the Conference on Human Sentence Processing. We test a prediction of ours ([Huang & Phillips, 2021](https://doi.org/10.5334/gjgl.1292)) concerning the processing of these illusions.
+ Welcome [Serene Siow](https://siowserene.carrd.co/)! Serene, who has interests in language acquisition (and more broadly, psycholinguistics) and bilingualism, is joining a project I have on attitude verbs, as a postdoctoral research fellow; this project is generously funded by a Tier One grant from the Singapore Ministry of Education.
+ I gave one of the plenary talks at the [7th Asian Junior Linguists Conference](https://sites.google.com/view/ajl7/home), held at the International Christian University, Tokyo, Japan. I presented some of my work on attitude verbs -- special thanks to the conference organizers for the invitation.
