I am an assistant professor at the [Department of English, Linguistics and Theatre Studies](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/elts/) at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). I currently serve on the editorial board of the [Journal of East Asian Linguistics](https://link.springer.com/journal/10831).

Recent updates (Feb 2025)
======
+ Visiting the US in March: first for [TEAL 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/teal14/home) (talk with Cai Jiajia) and then [HSP 2025](https://hsp2025.github.io/) (posters with Colin Phillips; Serene Siow).
+ Co-organising [AMLaP Asia 2024](https://blog.nus.edu.sg/amlapasia2024/) at NUS, 5-7 December 2024 (and presenting a poster with Serene Siow and Rachel Dudley).

What I do
======
I am a linguist interested in understanding the relation between linguistic experience, sentence processing, and grammatical rules and what that relation might mean for our theories of language and the mind. More specifically, I'm interested in questions like:
1. How do children make use of what is spoken around them to figure out the grammatical rules of their native languages? 
1. How are adults apply these rules in production and comprehension?
1. But a more basic question: what are these grammatical rules? And what are the facts like for production and comprehension?
 
On a day-to-day basis, I develop more precise descriptions of linguistic knowledge and behaviour (Question 3), often taking a cross-linguistic perspective and using formal experiments. Addressing this question sets the stage for addressing Questions 1 and 2, which I tackle with a combination of corpus analyses, computational models, and experiments.

Finally, as someone who grew up in a multilingual environment in Singapore, I am also interested in dialectal variation and language contact, especially Singapore English.

Some specific topics that I have worked on:
+ cross-linguistic differences in the syntax and meaning of attitude verbs, such as "think", "want", "know", and how children might learn what the facts are for these verbs in their native languages.
+ the syntax, pragmatics, and psycholinguistics of long-distance dependencies (e.g. wh-questions), which again involve attitude verbs.
+ cross-linguistic differences in whether ungrammatical sentences sound bad or surprisingly OK (i.e. "grammaticality illusions").
+ Singapore English and how certain aspects of its grammar might be traced (or not!) to adstrate languages like English, Chinese, and Malay varieties.

Collaboration and supervision
======
NUS is an exciting place for doing linguistics (especially languages of East and Southeast Asia), with [lab facilities, corpora](https://z-n-huang.github.io/nus-resources/), and a community of [like-minded faculty and students](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/elts/). 
Please get in touch if you are interested.
